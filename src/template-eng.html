               of family and social destruction. A family unit is eradicated because their land no longer belongs to them”. These simple words by Adriana, exiled from Zara, explain what the postwar period meant for Italians who lived on the Eastern Adriatic coast much better than the endless political and historic debates on the Eastern border.
            </p>

            <p fade>
              Julian-Dalmatians’ history is one of sorrow, of lives uprooted and painfully reestablished elsewhere. For those involuntarily affected by the exodus, it is a recollection of eradication; fear of the Yugoslav police; remembering a father hastily executed; hugging a grandfather who decided to stay and die in his own home; the desperation of “leaving everything behind”, and, finally, the shame for the way they were treated arriving at refugees camps. Seventy years after, eyes are still full of tears. Through the gaze of its direct witnesses, Il Piccolo celebrates its 140 years of existence by retracing this thread of history that the newspaper has contributed to document.
            </p>

            <p fade>
              On account of the exodus, an entire society disappeared. Over 300,000 Italians left their land. Istria’s coastal cities were emptied and roots were cut. Then, “silence hit us for 60 years”: oblivion descended upon a sequence of events that makes everyone uneasy, kept alive by refugees’ associations and exploited too many times. Replaced now, after a long and difficult process, by reconciliation among Italians, Slovenians and Croatians. Each side has its own recollections yet is willing to reach out to the other. As stated by an individual in one of the recorded videos, because “borders should no longer exist”; someone who understands the value of peaceful coexistence and, by contrast, the horrific face of nationalism and totalitarianism.

              <p>First, they were “just” refugees. Then, at the beginning of 1946, they became exiles for the first time.</p>

              <p>How did the press cover their drama at the time, as it was unfolding? Il Piccolo of Trieste – the newspaper that predominantly covered the Italians forced to leave Istria, Fiume and Dalmatia in the postwar period – looked for answers, which were, all along, in its own archives. In the gallery, a glimpse of the research conducted by Jacopo Bassi on hundreds of titles, articles and photo news published between 1945 and 1956.</p>

The fear of the military and of the new regime. A family member arrested and never seen again. The heinous killing of Norma Cossetto. Pressure increased, and most Italians abandoned their homes, leaving for an uncertain future. Roots were cut: “I never had the courage to set foot in my home again”.</p>

            A steady flow of Italians departing from the Eastern Adriatic coast continued for 15 years. The first to leave were Zara’s citizens, after the Allies’ bombings in 1943-1944. Right after, it was Istria and Fiume’s turn, starting with Pola’s evacuation in February 1947. Then, the B Zone residents: a departure started in 1953, increased after the signing of the Memorandum of understanding of London that awarded the last strip of Istria to Yugoslavia, and continued until the end of the 1950’s.

            <h3>A GRAVEYARD OF OBJECTS</h3>
            <p class="underlined" fade>
            To this day, Trieste’s Old Harbour stores in one of its warehouses the strongest visual testimony of what the exodus meant to refugees. It was discovered by many citizens of Trieste, thanks to Simone Cristicchi’s theatrical performance, Magazzino 18 (Warehouse 18). Heaps of chairs, wardrobes, photographs, notebooks, kitchenware, and other small objects: silent remnants of the journey to Italy, abandoned by those who could not reclaim them once having reached their home country.
            </p>
            <p>Those who had decided to leave had to take everything they could in the shortest amount of time and put it on wagons and ships bound for Trieste, and from there into the unknown. Those were the lucky ones, because those who chose to leave during the night could only fill their backpacks with a change of clothes and a few beloved objects. Household goods were piled up in the Old Harbour and what was unclaimed remain there to this day.</p>

            <div class="quote animation-text">
              <span>Walking through the facility</span>
              <span>you discover an array of items</span>
            </div>

            <p>Objects were first accommodated in the halls of Magazzino 22, and subsequently moved to Magazzino 18, where they remained for decades. The efforts of Istituto regionale per la cultura istriano-fiumano-dalmata (Regional institute for the Istrian, Fiuman, Dalmatian culture) and Simone Cristicchi’s performance preserved them and brought them back to light: today, those household effects are a permanent exhibition in Magazzino 26, transformed from objects of individual memories into a collective heritage.</p>

            <p>Walking through the facility, you discover an array of items: wardrobes with the owner’s name written on the back with a piece of chalk; family pictures; children’s notebooks; work tools; a fishing net. These are modest possessions, fossils of a lost ordinary life, owned by impoverished people who could not retain what they had shipped and were not permitted to transport their belongings to a refugee camp.</p>

            <h3>THE HUMILIATION OF REFUGEE CAMPS</h3>
            <p class="underlined" fade>
             Accommodating the exiles was not easy for Italy, a country on its knees. Those who could not find a way to support themselves were hosted in refugee camps for years, in some cases. The Italian peninsula is dotted with similar structures, sometimes converted from former concentration camps. Life in the camp was “demeaning and dramatic “: families crammed in cubicles with no privacy or toilet, structures so precarious that in Padriciano a little girl froze to death during the harsh winter of 1956.
            </p>
            <p>«It was below zero inside the cubicle, and one night my sister got so cold… we called an ambulance, but they could not do anything. Marinella had frozen to death”. Fiore, from Grisignana, offers the most dramatic testimony on life at the refugee camp in Padriciano, in Trieste: one of the 109 created since 1947 to accommodate Julian-Dalmatian exiles, who were mostly not self-sufficient. In order to make more spaces available, the Government converted barracks, hospitals, monasteries, disused factories and even former concentration camps, like Risiera di Sabba (San Sabba Rice Mill) or Fossoli. </p>

            <div class="quote animation-text">
              <span>It was a dramatic time</span>
              <span>and I still hold it within</span>
            </div>

            <p>For the most part, exiles went through Trieste and were quickly “fanned out” (this is the term used by authorities), with no chance to express a preference: they had to adapt to availability. What they were presented with was unseemly: the cubicles were a few square meters, partitioned by sheets or wooden panels. In 1963, 8,500 people remained in the centers that were still open. The last one closed in 1975.</p>

            <p>«It was a dramatic time and I still hold it within”. Memories tell stories of precarious hygienic conditions, the humiliation of having one’s fingerprints taken, the sensation of being punished for the fascist war. Integration was not easy because exiles were isolated: citizens saw them as people receiving subsidies and threatening competitors looking for a job. “We were exiles, they did not want us. The stigma remained”. </p>

              <p>Actresses, athletes, intellectuals, singers, fashion designers, chefs.

The long journey of the Istrian exodus took her first to Naples then to Rome, where she was introduced to cinema. With Femi Benussi, Alida Valli and Sylva Koscina, she formed the “Bellissime quattro” group, Istrian and Dalmatian artists who made a great impression on Italians. Her success peaked between the 1970s and the 1980s, from erotic comedies and drama to pure entertainment and auteur cinema.

In 1958, she moved again, to the United States this time, where her extraordinary entrepreneurial adventure started. She opened her first restaurant in Queens, New York, in her early twenties. In 1981, she inaugurated Felidia in Manhattan. There, she prepared jota, gulasch, frico, octopus salad and offered other regional specialties. It was a success. Lidia studied, published cookbooks, hosted TV shows. She has created an empire in the food industry. In addition, she has become the ambassador of Italian cuisine in the United States.

When he was just 16, he had to leave his home, ending up in Trieste, where he was met with prejudice and indifference. Boxing became a way to redemption. In the ring, where he looked more like a dancer, he moved his way up quickly. Olympic champion in 1960, world champion of mid-weights between 1967 and 1970, he is one of the most beloved athletes of all times in Italy. His first match of the trilogy against Emile Griffith at the Madison Square Garden, on 17 April 1967, became legendary. Since 1996, his name stands out in the International Boxing Hall of Fame.

First, he moved with his family to Gorizia then to Milan, as a refugee. “I am an exile in the most complete sense of the word: an organic exile, more than by birth”, he confessed to Il Piccolo in an interview when he was already known as a top-level journalist and an established writer. In his novels and essays, he described the ghosts, the tensions and the contradictions of Central Europe fallen into the Soviet Union’s orbit. He started his journalistic career at Epoca weekly magazine, then moved to La Stampa and Corriere della Sera. In 1974, with Indro Montanelli, he led the split-up that resulted into the birth of Il Giornale nuovo newspaper.

He moved, as a refugee, first to Brindisi then to Venice. More than 20 years after, he told the story of his family “expelled from Pola” in his song 1947. “I did not suffer much at that time, I was 14 and to me leaving was like an adventure. Not so for my mother: having to abandon her home, friends, familiar places and street scenes, was a huge blow for her. Adults suffered greatly. So, I sang about it, with them in mind, not so much myself”. A cultured and reflective songwriter, he won the Sanremo Song Festival in 1968 with Canzone per te, then came in second with Lontano dagli occhi, and third with L’arca di Noè. In his long career, he collaborated with writers, poets, musicians: from Gianni Rodari to Pier Paolo Pasolini; from Vinicius de Moraes to Giuseppe Ungaretti; from Toquinho to Luis Bacalov, with whom he won a posthumous Oscar for Il postino’s soundtrack.

                <div class="text-mosaico">
                  Agostino Straulino, “Son of the sea”, “Master of the wind”, a living legend, was born in Lussinpiccolo on 10 October 1914. When he was a child, his father and his uncle built for him a little boat, “Sogliola” (Sole), and “Tino” began to sail. After his diploma, he wandered throughout Dalmatia on “Lanzarda”, an eight-meter “passera”, a typical, traditional boat, with the company of his dog, Mark. He enrolled in the Naval Academy in Livorno, raced for the Academy, raked in victories and qualified for the Olympic Games in Berlin in 1936. War broke out. He was deployed on the cruiser “Garibaldi”, where he remained until 1942, when he joined the Gamma frogmen units and received two medals for bravery. After 1943, he left the Decima Mas and tried to go back home but was jailed by the Jugoslav partisans. He tried to evade capture several times, succeeded, but was subsequently captured by the Germans. He was sent to forced labor. He finally managed to escape by boat and reached Trieste. Back in the Navy, the war over, he was assigned to mine-clearing work in national ports. During one mission, in 1947, he was struck by a blast of mustard gas and partially lost his sight. He slowly recovered but was affected by the incident for the rest of his life. That is when he started training at night. After the disappointment of London’s Olympic Games, he recorded an incredible progression of victories until 1959.
                  In just one year, 1952, he won an Olympic gold, he was world champion, European champion, and Italian champion. In 1956 he commanded the training ship Amerigo Vespucci. His memorable passage through the Taranto Channel in full sail and piloting the ship up the Thames to London became legendary. On 11 October 1972, he stepped down from active service, with the title of vice Admiral. He continued to participate in and win several sailing regattas in the over-60 category, the last of which in 2002, when he was 88. In 2002 he was awarded the “ordine di Cavaliere di Gran Croce della Repubblica Italiana” (Order of the Great Cross of the Italian Republic). He died on 14 December 2004. He is buried in the family tomb in Lussinpiccolo: his homecoming.

              <div class="text-mosaico">
              Giorgio Luxardo was born in Zara on 1 September 1897 to a family of entrepreneurs: Girolamo, the head of the family, had a brilliant intuition and started an industrial production of the “rosolio maraschino”, a liquor obtained from distilled marasca cherries from Zara. Giorgio started working at the family factory at 25, along with his brothers Nicolò, Demetrio and Pietro, and contributed to its growth. World War II inflicted a deathblow to Luxardo’s business: first, the shortage of raw materials; a huge fire; the occupation of Tito’s partisans; his brothers’ deaths; the confiscation of property, and finally the destruction of the factory. Giorgio had to leave Dalmatia and accomplished a miracle: he transferred his activity to the hills of Torreglia, in the province of Padua, where he managed to grow marasca cherries from Zara and reopened a factory, diversifying production, in 1947. He died on 1 July 1963.

              <div class="text-mosaico">
              Fulvio Tomizza was born in Materada, Istria, on 26 January 1935. His childhood was not easy, interethnic conflicts were raging and after the war his father was sent to prison twice and their properties were confiscated. His family moved to Trieste. After his father’s death, he succeeded in bringing him back to Materada, and afterwards he moved to Belgrade to study. In 1955, after the Memorandum of understanding of London was signed, he went back to Trieste where he worked as a journalist. His literary debut was in 1957, three short stories that awarded him the Cinque Bettole di Bordighera literary prize. In 1966, he started to publish his Istrian Trilogy, composed of Materada, La ragazza di Petrovia, Il bosco di acacie. A “frontier writer”, author of plays and novels such as La finzione di Maria, Gli sposi di via Rossetti and Franziska, he won several prizes and was awarded the Premio Strega for La miglior vita. He died in Trieste on 21 May 1999. He is buried in his hometown, Materada, according to his wishes.

              <p>They left Istria and Dalmatia and redeemed themselves through hardships and success in sports. They are champions: Benvenuti (boxing), Andretti (car racing), Straulino (sailing), Loik (soccer), Pamich and Missoni (athletics). Andretti speaks with an American accent but Montona is still in his heart. Benvenuti left Isola in 1954 and still remembers “the political police officer telling my mother we would have to leave the following day: my inner desire for redemption drove all my successes”.</p>

            <h3>THE FUTURE, AT LAST </h3>
            <p fade>
              A young student explains, “memory not only entails a recollection of how events unfolded, but also returns a dignity to those who lived and were personally affected by this terrible tragedy”. Today, memory and historical reconstruction can peacefully coexist, even more so after a new page was opened by the Italian and Slovenian Presidents (Sergio Mattarella and Borut Pahor), who joined hands in the symbolic locations of the violence perpetrated in Trieste by Nazi fascists and Communists.

              <span>Today, memory and historical reconstruction</span>
              <span>can peacefully coexist</span>
            </div>
            <p>To arrive at this point, it was first necessary to open a dialogue in Italy: a path traced by Gianfranco Fini and Luciano Violante in 1998, that led - six years after - to establishing the “Giorno del Ricordo” (Day of Remembrance). Its goal was to finally ensure that the troubled history of the Eastern border was known to the whole Nation. Following those threads digitally is essential in order to communicate with youth, who, perhaps for the first time, can be acquainted with an unburdened narration, that can finally be consigned to history without ignoring the lives of ordinary people, who were mostly bystanders or victims of history. </p>


            <p>
            The postwar period did not only bring deep wounds. Since the 1960s, the border between Italy and Slovenia continued to separate two worlds but was the most accessible border established along the Iron Curtain. Some exiles could not even think to return and visit their homeland, but others reestablished a link to Istria, which is, to this day, a wonderfully varied place for languages and identities. The fall of Communism and the European integration are doing the rest, after a long journey of mutual understanding that is up to youth to make irreversible.</p>
